Plist2Objc is a tool that converts property list objects to Objective-C style literal initializers.
Its output is valid Objective-C code, and can be used to populate an NSArray or NSDictionary by copy-pasting it.

It's perhaps not the best concept to have large property lists hardcoded in a program, but anyway, this may be needed.
(This tool was insipired by this StackOverflow-question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13055259/convert-plist-code-into-nsdictionary-format/13055296#13055296)

Usage:
	plist2objc <file.plist>

This will pretty-print the generated Objective-C code equivalent of the structure of the specified plist file.

An example use (untested) may be:

	// SomeCodeFile.m.bak
	NSDictionary *dict = DICTIONARY_INITIALIZER_HERE;

then:

	export DICT=`plist2objc file.plist`
	sed s/DICTIONARY_INITIALIZER_HERE/$DICT/g SomeCodeFile.m.bak >SomeCodeFile.m
